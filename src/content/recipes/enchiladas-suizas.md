This is a tangy and fresh version of enchiladas. The sauce is delicious and the star of the recipe.  You could easily tweak this a bit and use several different peppers. Fire roasting the peppers and tomatillos would be a nice smokey touch as well. 

A couple of notes:

1. You could easily replace chicken with whatever you have available, this would be delicious with roasted and pulled pork or some well seasoned black beans as a filling. The chicken is good, but it is not the star. 
2. I made this using my Immerssion Circulator. I cooked the chicken and vegetables in seperate bags at 162.5 for about 1.5 hours, once the chicken is cooked through,turn up the temp to 185 for another 30-45 minutes to get the vegetables nice and soft. This makes the recipe mostly hands off until you start assembly.
